# Jadmin
Jadmin is a remade version of EasyAdmin produced by Jonny D Development
I made Jadmin because i was unhappy with the basic restrictions of EasyAdmin. I will be adding more configuration and features to Jadmin.

For support go to (https://discord.gg/F8E8pm4sKQ)
The defult command to open Jadmin menu is "/jadmin" you can add your own button using 'setr ja_MenuButton "letter of button" ' in your Server.Cfg
Add 'ja_LanguageName "en" ' to your Server.Cfg, as english is the only supported language as of V.1
Add 'add_ace group."what rank you want" jadmin allow' to your server.cfg
Currently all ranks have acsess to all commands. singular permission command lines will be added in Jadmin-V.2
Join the discord (https://discord.gg/F8E8pm4sKQ) for further updates on Jadmin

Do not claim my work as your own. Base code is from EasyAdmin.
